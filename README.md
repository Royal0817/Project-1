# HOW TO PLAY THE GAME

Player will use the directional arrows on keyboard to interact with the game. Each time an arrow is pressed, the boxes will move in the direction of the arrow. 
When two boxes with the same number are side by side, the two boxes will merge to create the sum of the two boxes. Exp: two boxes are 2 and 2, they will merge to create 4
Your score will be calculated by adding the sum of merged boxes.
